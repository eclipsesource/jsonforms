A URL pattern consists of a path pattern, optionally followed by '?' and a list\n\t * of search parameters. Multiple search parameter names are separated by '&'. Search parameters\n\t * do not influence whether or not a URL is matched, but their values are passed through into\n\t * the matched parameters returned by {@link ui.router.util.type:UrlMatcher#methods_exec exec}.\n\t *\n\t * Path parameter placeholders can be specified using simple colon/catch-all syntax or curly brace\n\t * syntax, which optionally allows a regular expression for the parameter to be specified:\n\t *\n\t * * `':'` name - colon placeholder\n\t * * `'*'` name - catch-all placeholder\n\t * * `'{' name '}'` - curly placeholder\n\t * * `'{' name ':' regexp|type '}'` - curly placeholder with regexp or type name. Should the\n\t *   regexp itself contain curly braces, they must be in matched pairs or escaped with a backslash.\n\t *\n\t * Parameter names may contain only word characters (latin letters, digits, and underscore) and\n\t * must be unique within the pattern (across both path and search parameters). For colon\n\t * placeholders or curly placeholders without an explicit regexp, a path parameter matches any\n\t * number of characters other than '/'. For catch-all placeholders the path parameter matches\n\t * any number of characters.\n\t *\n\t * Examples:\n\t *\n\t * * `'/hello/'` - Matches only if the path is exactly '/hello/'. There is no special treatment for\n\t *   trailing slashes, and patterns have to match the entire path, not just a prefix.\n\t * * `'/user/:id'` - Matches '/user/bob' or '/user/1234!!!' or even '/user/' but not '/user' or\n\t *   '/user/bob/details'. The second path segment will be captured as the parameter 'id'.\n\t * * `'/user/{id}'` - Same as the previous example, but using curly brace syntax.\n\t * * `'/user/{id:[^/]*}'` - Same as the previous example.\n\t * * `'/user/{id:[0-9a-fA-F]{1,8}}'` - Similar to the previous example, but only matches if the id\n\t *   parameter consists of 1 to 8 hex digits.\n\t * * `'/files/{path:.*}'` - Matches any URL starting with '/files/' and captures the rest of the\n\t *   path into the parameter 'path'.\n\t * * `'/files/*path'` - ditto.\n\t * * `'/calendar/{start:date}'` - Matches \"/calendar/2014-11-12\" (because the pattern defined\n\t *   in the built-in  `date` Type matches `2014-11-12`) and provides a Date object in $stateParams.start\n\t *\n\t * @param {string} pattern  The pattern to compile into a matcher.\n\t * @param {Object} config  A configuration object hash\n\t * * `caseInsensitive` - `true` if URL matching should be case insensitive, otherwise `false`, the default value (for backward compatibility) is `false`.\n\t * * `strict` - `false` if matching against a URL with a trailing slash should be treated as equivalent to a URL without a trailing slash, the default value is `true`.\n\t *\n\t * @property {string} prefix  A static prefix of this pattern. The matcher guarantees that any\n\t *   URL matching this matcher (i.e. any string for which {@link ui.router.util.type:UrlMatcher#methods_exec exec()} returns\n\t *   non-null) will start with this prefix.\n\t *\n\t * @property {string} pattern  The pattern that was passed into the constructor\n\t *\n\t * @returns {Object}  New `UrlMatcher` object\n\t */\n\tvar UrlMatcher = (function () {\n\t    function UrlMatcher(pattern, config) {\n\t        var _this = this;\n\t        this.pattern = pattern;\n\t        this.config = config;\n\t        this._cache = { path: [], pattern: null };\n\t        this._children = [];\n\t        this._params = [];\n\t        this._segments = [];\n\t        this._compiled = [];\n\t        this.config = common_1.defaults(this.config, {\n\t            params: {},\n\t            strict: true,\n\t            caseInsensitive: false,\n\t            paramMap: common_1.identity\n\t        });\n\t        // Find all placeholders and create a compiled pattern, using either classic or curly syntax:\n\t        //   '*' name\n\t        //   ':' name\n\t        //   '{' name '}'\n\t        //   '{' name ':' regexp '}'\n\t        // The regular expression is somewhat complicated due to the need to allow curly braces\n\t        // inside the regular expression.

There's not really a compelling reason to name a view if its the only one,\n\t * but you could if you wanted, like so:\n\t *\n\t * ```html\n\t *\n\t * <div ui-view=\"main\"></div>\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * ```js\n\t *\n\t * $stateProvider.state(\"home\", {\n\t *   views: {\n\t *     \"main\": {\n\t *       template: \"<h1>HELLO!</h1>\"\n\t *     }\n\t *   }\n\t * })\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * Really though, you'll use views to set up multiple views:\n\t * ```html\n\t *\n\t * <div ui-view></div>\n\t * <div ui-view=\"chart\"></div>\n\t * <div ui-view=\"data\"></div>\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * ```js\n\t * $stateProvider.state(\"home\", {\n\t *   views: {\n\t *     \"\": {\n\t *       template: \"<h1>HELLO!</h1>\"\n\t *     },\n\t *     \"chart\": {\n\t *       template: \"<chart_thing/>\"\n\t *     },\n\t *     \"data\": {\n\t *       template: \"<data_thing/>\"\n\t *     }\n\t *   }\n\t * })\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * Examples for `autoscroll`:\n\t *\n\t * ```html\n\t *\n\t * <!-- If autoscroll present with no expression,\n\t *      then scroll ui-view into view -->\n\t * <ui-view autoscroll/>\n\t *\n\t * <!-- If autoscroll present with valid expression,\n\t *      then scroll ui-view into view if expression evaluates to true -->\n\t * <ui-view autoscroll='true'/>\n\t * <ui-view autoscroll='false'/>\n\t * <ui-view autoscroll='scopeVariable'/>\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * Resolve data:\n\t *\n\t * The resolved data from the state's `resolve` block is placed on the scope as `$resolve` (this\n\t * can be customized using [[ViewDeclaration.resolveAs]]).  This can be then accessed from the template.\n\t *\n\t * Note that when `controllerAs` is being used, `$resolve` is set on the controller instance *after* the\n\t * controller is instantiated.  The `$onInit()` hook can be used to perform initialization code which\n\t * depends on `$resolve` data.\n\t *\n\t * @example\n\t * ```js\n\t *\n\t * $stateProvider.state('home', {\n\t *   template: '<my-component user=\"$resolve.user\"></my-component>',\n\t *   resolve: {\n\t *     user: function(UserService) { return UserService.fetchUser(); }\n\t *   }\n\t * });\n\t * ```\n\t */\n\tvar

Though not all\n   * necessarily have a good use case for decoration, that is up to you to decide.\n   *\n   * In addition, users can attach custom decorators, which will generate new\n   * properties within the state's internal definition. There is currently no clear\n   * use-case for this beyond accessing internal states (i.e. $state.$current),\n   * however, expect this to become increasingly relevant as we introduce additional\n   * meta-programming features.\n   *\n   * **Warning**: Decorators should not be interdependent because the order of\n   * execution of the builder functions in non-deterministic.

A URL pattern consists of a path pattern, optionally followed by '?' and a list\n * of search parameters. Multiple search parameter names are separated by '&'. Search parameters\n * do not influence whether or not a URL is matched, but their values are passed through into\n * the matched parameters returned by {@link ui.router.util.type:UrlMatcher#methods_exec exec}.\n *\n * Path parameter placeholders can be specified using simple colon/catch-all syntax or curly brace\n * syntax, which optionally allows a regular expression for the parameter to be specified:\n *\n * * `':'` name - colon placeholder\n * * `'*'` name - catch-all placeholder\n * * `'{' name '}'` - curly placeholder\n * * `'{' name ':' regexp|type '}'` - curly placeholder with regexp or type name. Should the\n *   regexp itself contain curly braces, they must be in matched pairs or escaped with a backslash.\n *\n * Parameter names may contain only word characters (latin letters, digits, and underscore) and\n * must be unique within the pattern (across both path and search parameters). For colon\n * placeholders or curly placeholders without an explicit regexp, a path parameter matches any\n * number of characters other than '/'. For catch-all placeholders the path parameter matches\n * any number of characters.\n *\n * Examples:\n *\n * * `'/hello/'` - Matches only if the path is exactly '/hello/'. There is no special treatment for\n *   trailing slashes, and patterns have to match the entire path, not just a prefix.\n * * `'/user/:id'` - Matches '/user/bob' or '/user/1234!!!' or even '/user/' but not '/user' or\n *   '/user/bob/details'. The second path segment will be captured as the parameter 'id'.\n * * `'/user/{id}'` - Same as the previous example, but using curly brace syntax.\n * * `'/user/{id:[^/]*}'` - Same as the previous example.\n * * `'/user/{id:[0-9a-fA-F]{1,8}}'` - Similar to the previous example, but only matches if the id\n *   parameter consists of 1 to 8 hex digits.\n * * `'/files/{path:.*}'` - Matches any URL starting with '/files/' and captures the rest of the\n *   path into the parameter 'path'.\n * * `'/files/*path'` - ditto.\n * * `'/calendar/{start:date}'` - Matches \"/calendar/2014-11-12\" (because the pattern defined\n *   in the built-in  `date` Type matches `2014-11-12`) and provides a Date object in $stateParams.start\n *\n * @param {string} pattern  The pattern to compile into a matcher.\n * @param {Object} config  A configuration object hash\n * * `caseInsensitive` - `true` if URL matching should be case insensitive, otherwise `false`, the default value (for backward compatibility) is `false`.\n * * `strict` - `false` if matching against a URL with a trailing slash should be treated as equivalent to a URL without a trailing slash, the default value is `true`.\n *\n * @property {string} prefix  A static prefix of this pattern.

The name should be unique amongst the other views in the\n * same state. You can have views of the same name that live in different states.\n *\n * @param {string=} autoscroll It allows you to set the scroll behavior of the browser window\n * when a view is populated. By default, $anchorScroll is overridden by ui-router's custom scroll\n * service, {@link ui.router.state.$uiViewScroll}. This custom service let's you\n * scroll ui-view elements into view when they are populated during a state activation.\n *\n * *Note: To revert back to old [`$anchorScroll`](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$anchorScroll)\n * functionality, call `$uiViewScrollProvider.useAnchorScroll()`.*\n *\n * @param {string=} onload Expression to evaluate whenever the view updates.\n *\n * A view can be unnamed or named.\n * @example\n * ```html\n *\n * <!-- Unnamed -->\n * <div ui-view></div>\n *\n * <!-- Named -->\n * <div ui-view=\"viewName\"></div>\n * ```\n *\n * You can only have one unnamed view within any template (or root html). If you are only using a\n * single view and it is unnamed then you can populate it like so:\n * ```\n *\n * <div ui-view></div>\n * $stateProvider.state(\"home\", {\n *   template: \"<h1>HELLO!</h1>\"\n * })\n * ```\n *\n * The above is a convenient shortcut equivalent to specifying your view explicitly with the {@link ui.router.state.$stateProvider#views `views`}\n * config property, by name, in this case an empty name:\n * ```js\n *\n * $stateProvider.state(\"home\", {\n *   views: {\n *     \"\": {\n *       template: \"<h1>HELLO!</h1>\"\n *     }\n *   }\n * })\n * ```\n *\n * But typically you'll only use the views property if you name your view or have more than one view\n * in the same template. There's not really a compelling reason to name a view if its the only one,\n * but you could if you wanted, like so:\n *\n * ```html\n *\n * <div ui-view=\"main\"></div>\n * ```\n *\n * ```js\n *\n * $stateProvider.state(\"home\", {\n *   views: {\n *     \"main\": {\n *       template: \"<h1>HELLO!</h1>\"\n *     }\n *   }\n * })\n * ```\n *\n * Really though, you'll use views to set up multiple views:\n * ```html\n *\n * <div ui-view></div>\n * <div ui-view=\"chart\"></div>\n * <div ui-view=\"data\"></div>\n * ```\n *\n * ```js\n * $stateProvider.state(\"home\", {\n *   views: {\n *     \"\": {\n *       template: \"<h1>HELLO!</h1>\"\n *     },\n *     \"chart\": {\n *       template: \"<chart_thing/>\"\n *     },\n *     \"data\": {\n *       template: \"<data_thing/>\"\n *     }\n *   }\n * })\n * ```\n *\n * Examples for `autoscroll`:\n *\n * ```html\n *\n * <!-- If autoscroll present with no expression,\n *      then scroll ui-view into view -->\n * <ui-view autoscroll/>\n *\n * <!-- If autoscroll present with valid expression,\n *      then scroll ui-view into view if expression evaluates to true -->\n * <ui-view autoscroll='true'/>\n * <ui-view autoscroll='false'/>\n * <ui-view autoscroll='scopeVariable'/>\n * ```\n *\n * Resolve data:\n *\n * The resolved data from the state's `resolve` block is placed on the scope as `$resolve` (this\n * can be customized using [[ViewDeclaration.resolveAs]]).  This can be then accessed from the template.\n *\n * Note that when `controllerAs` is being used, `$resolve` is set on the controller instance *after* the\n * controller is instantiated.  The `$onInit()` hook can be used to perform initialization code which\n * depends on `$resolve` data.\n *\n * @example\n * ```js\n *\n * $stateProvider.state('home', {\n *   template: '<my-component user=\"$resolve.user\"></my-component>',\n *   resolve: {\n *     user: function(UserService) { return UserService.fetchUser(); }\n *   }\n * });\n * ```\n */\nlet uiViewNg1 = ['$view', '$animate',
