# Roadmap

This roadmap defines our current view on how we will continue with the development of JSON Forms on a very coarse-grained level and is subject to change at any time:


H2/2019
 * Separation of core components and add-ons
 * Strict application of semantic versioning
 * Yeoman-based scafolding support 
 * Eclipse Theia Integration of a JSONForms-based Editor
