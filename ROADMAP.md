# Roadmap

This roadmap defines our current view on how we will continue with the development of JSON Forms on a very coarse-grained level and is subject to change at any time:


H1/2019:
 * Renderer for Angular Material
 * JSON Schema for UI Schema to ease integration in other tools
 H2/2019
 * Separation of core components and add-ons
 * Strict application of semantic versioning
 * VS Code integration of Editor component
