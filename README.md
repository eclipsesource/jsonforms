## Developers Documentation

### First time setup

- Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (only Node v18.19+ < 19 is currently supported)
- Install pnpm: <https://pnpm.io/installation> (use pnpm 8.6.2+)
- Clone this repository
- Install dependencies: `pnpm i --frozen-lockfile`

### VS Code dev container

As an alternative to the first time setup, you can use the provided [VS Code dev container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) configured in [devcontainer.json](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json).

- Execute command: `Remote Containers: Reopen in container`
- Wait until the container is built and loaded
- First time setup and an initial build of all packages has been executed in the container

**Note:** If you have installed dependencies before opening the remote container, its initialization might fail.
In this case, you can try to clean the repository with `git clean -dfx`. Beware that this removes all untracked files!

### Build & Testing

- Build (all packages): `pnpm run build`
- Test (all packages): `pnpm run test`
- Clean (delete `dist` folder of all packages): `pnpm run clean`
- Run React Vanilla examples: `cd packages/vanilla-renderers && pnpm run dev`
- Run React Material examples: `cd packages/material-renderers && pnpm run dev`
- Run Angular Material examples: `cd packages/angular-material && pnpm run dev`
- Run Vue Vanilla dev setup: `cd packages/vue-vanilla && pnpm run serve`
