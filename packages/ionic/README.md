# JSONForms - More Forms. Less Code
### Complex Forms in the blink of an eye

JSONForms eliminates the tedious task of writing fully-featured forms by hand by leveraging the capabilities of JSON, JSON Schema and Javascript.

# Ionic Package

This is the JSONForms Ionic package which provides the necessary bindings for Ionic 3. 
It uses [JSONForms Core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsonforms/core) and the [JSONForms Angular]((https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsonforms/angular)) binding.


# License
The JSONForms project is licensed under the MIT License. See the [LICENSE file](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/blob/master/LICENSE) for more information.

# Roadmap
Our current roadmap is available [here](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/blob/master/ROADMAP.md).

# Development
JSONForms is developed by [EclipseSource](https://eclipsesource.com).
We are always very happy to have contributions, whether for trivial cleanups or big new features.
