# JSONForms - More Forms. Less Code
### Complex Forms in the blink of an eye

JSONForms eliminates the tedious task of writing fully-featured forms by hand by leveraging the capabilities of JSON, JSON Schema and Javascript.

# Vanilla Renderers Package
This is the JSONForms Vanilla Renderers Package. This package only contains renderers and must be combined with [JSONForms React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsonforms/react).

You can combine [JSONForms React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsonforms/react) with other renderers too, for example with the [Material Renderers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsonforms/material-renderers).

Check https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40jsonforms for all published JSONForms packages.

If you want to customize styling, have a look at our [styles guide](Styles.md).
