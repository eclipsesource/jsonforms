# JSONForms - More Forms. Less Code
### Complex Forms in the blink of an eye

JSONForms uses HTML custom elements and eliminates the need to write HTML templates in order to create forms by leveraging the capabilities of JSON and JSON schema.

# Test Package
This is the JSONForms test package. It can be used for testing packages which do not care about a specific renderer set being used, e.g. the i18n or the webcomponent package.

This package provides:
* `FakeLayout` which wraps all children into a `div` with the className `layout`.
* `FakeControl` which sets the scope of the control as its className
