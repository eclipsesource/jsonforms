# JSONForms - More Forms. Less Code
### Complex Forms in the blink of an eye

JSONForms eliminates the tedious task of writing fully-featured forms by hand by leveraging the capabilities of JSON, JSON Schema and Javascript.

# Test Package
This is the JSONForms test package. It can be used for testing packages which do not care about a specific renderer set being used, e.g. the i18n or the webcomponent package.

This package provides:
* `FakeLayout` which wraps all children into a `div` with the className `layout`.
* `FakeControl` which sets the scope of the control as its className
