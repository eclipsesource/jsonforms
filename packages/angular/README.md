# JSONForms - More Forms. Less Code
### Complex Forms in the blink of an eye

JSONForms eliminates the tedious task of writing fully-featured forms by hand by leveraging the capabilities of JSON, JSON Schema and Javascript.

# Angular Package
**NOTE**: This is a **private** package as it is still work-in-progress.

This is the JSONForms Angular package which provides the necessary bindings for Angular. It uses [JSONForms Core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsonforms/core).

You can combine the Angular package with any Angular-based renderer set you want, for example the [Material Renderers](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/blob/master/packages/angular-material).
