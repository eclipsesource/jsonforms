# JSONForms - More Forms. Less Code
### Complex Forms in the blink of an eye

JSONForms uses HTML custom elements and eliminates the need to write HTML templates in order to create forms by leveraging the capabilities of JSON and JSON schema.

# Angular Package
This is the JSONForms angular package which provides the necessary bindings for Angular. It uses [JSONForms Core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsonforms/core).

You can combine the angular package with any angular-based renderer set you want, for example the [Material Renderers](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/blob/master/packages/angular-material).

**This is a proof of concept currently and will evolve in the future.**
