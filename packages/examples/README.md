# JSON Forms - More Forms. Less Code

### Complex Forms in the blink of an eye

JSON Forms eliminates the tedious task of writing fully-featured forms by hand by leveraging the capabilities of JSON, JSON Schema and Javascript.

## Examples Package

This is the examples package which demonstrates how to integrate JSON Forms with your application.

You can use the examples with any react-based renderer set you want, for example the [Material Renderers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsonforms/material-renderers) or the [Angular Renderers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsonforms/vanilla-renderers).

Check <https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40jsonforms> for all published JSON Forms packages.
