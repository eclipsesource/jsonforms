# JSONForms - More Forms. Less Code
### Complex Forms in the blink of an eye

JSONForms uses HTML custom elements and eliminates the need to write HTML templates in order to create forms by leveraging the capabilities of JSON and JSON schema.

# Examples Package
This is the examples package which demonstrates how to integrate JSONForms with your application.

You can use the examples with any react-based renderer set you want, for example the [Material Renderers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsonforms/material-renderers) or the [Vanilla Renderers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsonforms/vanilla-renderers).

Check https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40jsonforms for all published JSONForms packages.
