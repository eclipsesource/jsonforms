# JSON Forms - More Forms. Less Code

*Complex forms in the blink of an eye*

JSON Forms eliminates the tedious task of writing fully-featured forms by hand by leveraging the capabilities of JSON, JSON Schema and Javascript.

## Examples Package

This is the examples package which demonstrates how to integrate JSON Forms with your application.

You can use the examples with any renderer set you want, for example the [Material Renderers](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/tree/master/packages/material) or the [Angular Renderers](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/tree/master/packages/angular-material).

Check <https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40jsonforms> for all published JSON Forms packages.
