# Json Editor
This repository contains a re-usable editor component that renders a tree-master-detail JSON editor by using [JsonForms 2](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/tree/jsonforms2).
Furthermore, the repository contains a standalone demo based on a JsonSchema resembling EMF's Ecore model.
