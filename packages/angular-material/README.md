# JSON Forms - More Forms. Less Code

### Complex Forms in the blink of an eye

JSON Forms eliminates the tedious task of writing fully-featured forms by hand by leveraging the capabilities of JSON, JSON Schema and Javascript.

## Angular Material Renderers Package

This is the JSONForms Angular Material renderers package. This package only contains renderers and must be combined with [JSON Forms Angular](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsonforms/angular).

Check <https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40jsonforms> for all published JSON Forms packages.

## License

The JSON Forms project is licensed under the MIT License. See the [LICENSE file](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/blob/master/LICENSE) for more information.

## Roadmap

Our current roadmap is available [here](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/blob/master/ROADMAP.md).

## Development

JSON Forms is developed by [EclipseSource](https://eclipsesource.com).
We are always very happy to have contributions, whether for trivial cleanups or big new features.

## Migration
