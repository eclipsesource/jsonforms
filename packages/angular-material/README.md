# JSONForms - More Forms. Less Code
### Complex Forms in the blink of an eye

JSONForms eliminates the tedious task of writing fully-featured forms by hand by leveraging the capabilities of JSON, JSON Schema and Javascript.

# Angular Material Renderers Package
**NOTE**: This is a **private** package as it is still work-in-progress.

This is the JSONForms Angular Material renderers package. This package only contains renderers and must be combined with  [JSONForms Angular](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/blob/master/packages/angular).
