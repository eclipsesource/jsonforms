# JSONForms - More Forms. Less Code
### Complex Forms in the blink of an eye

JSONForms uses HTML custom elements and eliminates the need to write HTML templates in order to create forms by leveraging the capabilities of JSON and JSON schema.

# Angular Material Renderers Package
This is the JSONForms Angular Material Renderers Package. This package only contains renderers and must be combined with  [JSONForms Angular](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/blob/master/packages/angular).

**This is a proof of concept currently and will evolve in the future.**
