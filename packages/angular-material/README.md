# JSONForms - More Forms. Less Code

### Complex Forms in the blink of an eye

JSONForms eliminates the tedious task of writing fully-featured forms by hand by leveraging the capabilities of JSON, JSON Schema and Javascript.

# Angular Material Renderers Package

This is the JSONForms Angular Material renderers package. This package only contains renderers and must be combined with [JSONForms Angular](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/blob/master/packages/angular).

# Get started

1. Clone and setup repo as descriped [in the JSON Forms Readme](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms)
2. `cd` to `packages/<this package>`
3. Run `npm run dev`
