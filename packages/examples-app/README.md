# JSON Forms - More Forms. Less Code

_Complex forms in the blink of an eye_

JSON Forms eliminates the tedious task of writing fully-featured forms by hand by leveraging the capabilities of JSON, JSON Schema and Javascript.

## Examples App

This package aggregates JSON Forms examples and makes them reachable via single `index.html` file.

Aggregating the examples assumes that packages were built and their examples bundled.
Afterwards, the examples app can be aggregated with [prepare-examples-app.js](./prepare-examples-app.js) into folder `dist`.
