 *
 * We must distinguish between dispatching functions in general and the base
 * `dispatch` function provided by the store instance without any middleware.
 *
 * The base dispatch function *always* synchronously sends an action to the
 * store's reducer, along with the previous state returned by the store, to
 * calculate a new state. It expects actions to be plain objects ready to be
 * consumed by the reducer.
 *
 * Middleware wraps the base dispatch function. It allows the dispatch
 * function to handle async actions in addition to actions. Middleware may
 * transform, delay, ignore, or otherwise interpret actions or async actions
 * before passing them to the next middleware.

   * considered the **next** state of the tree, and the change listeners will
   * be notified.
   *
   * The base implementation only supports plain object actions. If you want
   * to dispatch a Promise, an Observable, a thunk, or something else, you
   * need to wrap your store creating function into the corresponding
   * middleware. For example, see the documentation for the `redux-thunk`
   * package. Even the middleware will eventually dispatch plain object
   * actions using this method.
   *
   * @param action A plain object representing “what changed”. It is a good
   *   idea to keep actions serializable so you can record and replay user
   *   sessions, or use the time travelling `redux-devtools`. An action must
   *   have a `type` property which may not be `undefined`. It is a good idea
   *   to use string constants for action types.
   *
   * @returns For convenience, the same action object you dispatched.

   * Note that, if you use a custom middleware, it may wrap `dispatch()` to
   * return something else (for example, a Promise you can await).
