 * A *dispatching function* (or simply *dispatch function*) is a function that

 * or more actions to the store.
 *
 * We must distinguish between dispatching functions in general and the base
 * `dispatch` function provided by the store instance without any middleware.
 *
 * The base dispatch function *always* synchronously sends an action to the
 * store's reducer, along with the previous state returned by the store, to
 * calculate a new state. It expects actions to be plain objects ready to be
 * consumed by the reducer.
 *
 * Middleware wraps the base dispatch function. It allows the dispatch
 * function to handle async actions in addition to actions. Middleware may
 * transform, delay, ignore, or otherwise interpret actions or async actions
 * before passing them to the next middleware.

   * considered the **next** state of the tree, and the change listeners will
   * be notified.
   *
   * The base implementation only supports plain object actions. If you want
   * to dispatch a Promise, an Observable, a thunk, or something else, you

   * will use a more recent snapshot of the subscription list.

   * 2. The listener should not expect to see all states changes, as the state
   * might have been updated multiple times during a nested `dispatch()` before
   * the listener is called. It is, however, guaranteed that all subscribers
   * registered before the `dispatch()` started will be called with the latest

 * In Redux, the accumulated value is the state object, and the values being
 * accumulated are actions. Reducers calculate a new state given the previous
 * state and an action. They must be *pure functions*—functions that return
 * the exact same output for given inputs. They should also be free of
 * side-effects. This is what enables exciting features like hot reloading and
 * time travel.
