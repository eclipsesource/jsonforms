# JSON Forms - More Forms. Less Code

*Complex forms in the blink of an eye*

JSON Forms eliminates the tedious task of writing fully-featured forms by hand by leveraging the capabilities of JSON, JSON Schema and Javascript.

## Core Package

This is the JSON Forms core package. It provides the basic functionality needed to render forms.

In order to use JSON Forms Core you need to decide which UI framework you would like to use.

JSON Forms currently supports [React](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/blob/master/packages/react), [Angular](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/blob/master/packages/angular) and [Vue](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/blob/master/packages/vue).

The following seeds are available:
- [React Seed](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms-react-seed)
- [Angular Seed](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms-angular-seed)
- [Vue Seed](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms-vue-seed)

See the official [documentation](https://jsonforms.io/) and the [Example Package](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/blob/master/packages/examples) on how to integrate JSON Forms with your application.
