# JSONForms - More Forms. Less Code
### Complex Forms in the blink of an eye

JSONForms eliminates the tedious task of writing fully-featued forms by hand by leveraging the capabilities of JSON, JSON Schema and Javascript.

# Core Package
This is the JSONForms core package. This package provides basic functionality needed to render forms and is based on [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).

In order to use JSONForms Core you need to decide which UI framework you would like to use.

JSONForms currently supports [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsonforms/react). A proof of concept exists for [Angular](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/blob/master/packages/angular).

See the [Example Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsonforms/examples) on how to integrate JSONForms with your application.

Check https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40jsonforms for all published JSONForms packages.
