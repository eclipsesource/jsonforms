# JSONForms - More Forms. Less Code
### Complex Forms in the blink of an eye

JSONForms eliminates the tedious task of writing fully-featued forms by hand by leveraging the capabilities of JSON, JSON Schema and Javascript.

# Material Renderers Package
This is the JSONForms Material Renderers Package. This package only contains renderers and must be combined with [JSONForms React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsonforms/react).

You can combine [JSONForms React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsonforms/react) with other renderers too, for example with the [Vanilla Renderers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsonforms/vanilla-renderers).

Check https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40jsonforms for all published JSONForms packages.
