# JSONForms - More Forms. Less Code
### Complex Forms in the blink of an eye

JSONForms uses HTML custom elements and eliminates the need to write HTML templates in order to create forms by leveraging the capabilities of JSON and JSON schema.

# Material Renderers Package
This is the JSONForms Material Renderers Package. This package only contains renderers and must be combined with the [JSONForms Core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsonforms/core).

You can combine the [JSONForms Core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsonforms/core) with other renderers too, for example with the [Vanilla Renderers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsonforms/vanilla-renderers).

Check https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40jsonforms for all published JSONForms packages.
