# JSONForms - More Forms. Less Code
### Complex Forms in the blink of an eye

JSONForms eliminates the tedious task of writing fully-featued forms by hand by leveraging the capabilities of JSON, JSON Schema and Javascript.

# React Package
This is the JSONForms react package which provides the necessary bindings for React. It uses [JSONForms Core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsonforms/core).

You can combine the react package with any react-based renderer set you want, for example the [Material Renderers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsonforms/material-renderers) or the [Vanilla Renderers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsonforms/vanilla-renderers).

See the [Example Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsonforms/examples) on how to integrate JSONForms with your application.

Check https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40jsonforms for all published JSONForms packages.
